# Workflow
To contribute code/edit/etc:

1. [Install git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (if you haven't already)

2. Make a github account

3. Clone the repo:

        $ git clone https://github.com/voicesauce/opensauce-python.git
        $ cd opensauce-python

4. Write code, edit code, test code. To track files, use "git add":

        $ git add opensauce-python/path/to/file

5. Once you're ready to commit your changes, use "git commit":

        $ git commit -m "short description of your changes"

6. Push your changes to the cloud (it'll ask for your github username and password):

        $ git push

In order to sync your version of the repo with the master copy, use "git pull":

        $ git pull
