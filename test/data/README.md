Test data
=========

Sound files (.wav and corresponding .TextGrid files) are in the directory
`sound-files`.  These are the input data to the algorithms.

Raw VoiceSauce data is in the directory `raw-vs-output`.  This data is from the
intermediary .mat files produced by VoiceSauce.  The .mat files were converted
to JSON, in order to avoid proprietary data formats.  The data was generated by
VoiceSauce v1.31

The other directories contain test data for various test scripts.  The name of
the directory corresponds with the name of the test script.  For example, the
directory `shrp` contains the test data for `test_shrp.py`.

The JSON files can be rather large.  Since they contain test data and will
never be changed, we use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to manage these
files.
