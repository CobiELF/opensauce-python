Soundfile data files
--------------------

`beijing_f3_50_a-texttier.wav` is actually the exact same file as
`beijing_f3_50_a.wav`.  The corresponding TextGrid file has a dummy TextTier
item added, to check that tiers which are not of the IntervalTier class are
skipped when the sound file's TextGrid is processed.
