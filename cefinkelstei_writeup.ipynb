    "# OpenSauce conversion of Harmonics Measurements - Cobi Finkelstein\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal was to convert the VoiceSauce harmonics measurements, (usually abbreviated to HxAx, even though not all the measurements follow that format) to Python code for OpenSauce.\n",
    "# 1 - Introduction\n",
    "## 1.1 - The measurement, and what it's used for.\n",
    "HxAx measurements are used to measure voice quality, which are a set of features regarding the voice source. Perhaps the most common voice quality measure is the location of an utterance on Lodefoged's continuum from breathiness (loose vocal folds) to creakiness (tight vocal folds). In many languages, voice quality is a contrastive feature (e.g. some languages in SEA, India, and the Americas). In English, voice quality is not a contrastive feature, but we do care about perception!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several flavors of harmonics measurements:\n",
    "* F0 (also f0):    The fundamental frequency. Weâ€™ve gone over quite a few ways to guess/measure it.\n",
    "* Hx:        The amplitude of the x-th harmonic (1-indexed).\n",
    "* Ax:        The amplitude of the harmonic closest to the x-th formant (also 1-indexed).\n",
    "* xK:        The amplitude of the harmonic closest to x kHz (i.e. 2K, 5K)\n",
    "* (\\*):       Corrected\n",
    "\n",
    "Because all these measurements (with the exception of f0) are amplitude measurements, they can vary wildly between and within speakers because of loudness differences in speaking or recording. Therefore, we offset this problem by taking *difference* measures:\n",
    "* Hx(\\*)-Hx(\\*)\n",
    "* Hx(\\*)-Ax(\\*)\n",
    "* Hx(\\*)-xK(\\*)\n",
    "* 2K(\\*)-5K\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 - A high level overview of calculations\n",
    "For the Hx and measures, these are the high-level steps I noticed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given f0, make sure your f0 is accurate.\n",
    "2. For Hx, go to x\\*f0 and find the nearest peak.\n",
    "1. Correct for the influence of formants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, getting the measurements that depend on formants (i.e. Ax) boils down to three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Estimate the formants.\n",
    "1. Using the formants you estimated, estimate the bandwidth.\n",
    "1. Within the formant bandwidth you estimated, find the maximum value.\n",
    "1. Correct for the influence of formants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iseli et. al. developed a formant correction algorithm. It determines a value to be subtracted from the final measurement (i.e. it measures the influence of the formant).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2 - Code Project\n",
    "## 2.1 - Code Goals\n",
    "Following is a list of measurements I wanted to finish for this project:\n",
    "* H1(\\*)\n",
    "* H2(\\*)\n",
    "* H4(\\*)\n",
    "* A1(\\*)\n",
    "* A2(\\*)\n",
    "* A3(\\*)\n",
    "* 2K(\\*)\n",
    "* 5K\n",
    "* H1(\\*)-H2(\\*)\n",
    "* H2(\\*)-H4(\\*)\n",
    "* H1(\\*)-A1(\\*)\n",
    "* H1(\\*)-A2(\\*)\n",
    "* H1(\\*)-A3(\\*)\n",
    "* H4(\\*)-2K(\\*)\n",
    "* 2K(\\*)-5K\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, the difference measurements only require us to calculate the base measurements once, then subtract them!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 - Coding Progress/Testing Results\n",
    "I moved the goalposts on this project for myself so often and so far that there wasn't anything left by the end. Here's a rough breakdown of how they moved over the course of this project:\n",
    "1) Implement every harmonics calculation!\n",
    "1) `fminsearchbnd` is difficult, maybe I'll just compute Ax measurements, since that doesn't require the function.\n",
    "1) Ax measurements also require some helper functions I'm not confident implementing, so I reduced the scope to making unit tests for it.\n",
    "1) Turns out I didn't even have a black-box idea of what goes on with it, in either MATLAB or Python, so I'm left without a goal that's smaller than that.\n",
    "There are a few reasons why implementing this project was more difficult than expected:\n",
    "* I was not expecting this month to go by so quickly.\n",
    "* MATLAB doesn't let you run helper functions right from the CLI. Doing surgery on MATLAB code you've written ie exponentially easier than doing it on code someone else wrote.\n",
    "* Sometimes NumPy would sneak in where native Python was expected, and vice-versa.\n",
    "* Good old-fashioned hubris.\n",
    "* Lack of documentation for code internals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 - Key Lessons Learned\n",
    "* Documentation is a lot more important than I thought, and I already thought it was very important!\n",
    "* Unsurprisingly, MATLAB is really nice for working with matrices and lists!\n",
    "* NumPy handles these kinds of operations (e.g. element-wise list operators)\n",
    "* Figure out how the source code works (esp. if it works) before implementing it yourself!\n",
    "* Testing helper functions is a pain!\n",
    "* Top-down programming can be useful sometimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 - Future Work\n",
    "I don't think there's much to do with the code I wrote. I will suggest putting complete documentation in place for the project as-is (beyond just copying the MATLAB comments) before expanding it.\n",
